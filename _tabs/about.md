# About Me

Hello, I'm Vikas Choudhary, a software engineer with extensive experience in networking technologies and distributed systems.

My engineering journey has taken me through the core of telecommunications infrastructure, where I worked on **GGSN** and **SGSN** network solutions. I've had the privilege of implementing fundamental networking protocols, including userspace TCP implementations based on *RFC 793*, and developing kernel modules for network packet handling before tools like libnetwork were widely available.

I've always been drawn to the intersection of hardware and software, which led me to work with specialized networking hardware, including **DPDK**-based solutions and custom SoC implementations in platform support packages.

As cloud technologies emerged, I shifted my focus to **OpenStack**'s networking components and later became a contributor to **Kubernetes**, particularly in *SIG-Node*. My work there centered on enabling Kubernetes pods to leverage specialized Network Interface Cards and hardware acceleration.

My fascination with container networking extended to container runtimes and **Container Network Interface (CNI)** implementations, giving me a deep understanding of how modern containerized applications communicate.

Currently, I lead a team working on a highly scalable **service mesh** solution deployed in large enterprise environments. I'm also an active contributor to the **Envoy Proxy** project.

## Why This Blog?

I started this blog to share insights from my experiences and to continue learning through community engagement. I believe in the power of open-source collaboration and aim to contribute meaningfully to our collective knowledge.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss networking, Kubernetes, service meshes, or anything related to distributed systems architecture!
